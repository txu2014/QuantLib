<h1 class="center">QuantLib Git Repository</h1>

<h3>Using Git</h3>
<p>If you're new to Git, you can read the
free <a href="http://git-scm.com/book"><em>Pro Git</em></a> book; its
first couple of chapters contain the information you need to get
started.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines">the
commit guidelines in chapter 5.2</a> are suggested reading, especially
the part on commit messages.</p>


<h3>Repository access</h3>
<p>For the time being, the main repository is the one located on
GitHub
at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib">https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib</a>;
from there, you can also browse the code and the commit history.  If
you only want to check out the code, you can clone it directly by
issuing the command</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib.git
</pre>
<p>(if you're using some other tool, the actual steps might vary but
the same URL can be used).  However, and especially if you want to
contribute, a better way is to get a GitHub account, fork the
repository, and check out your fork to your computer.  This way,
you'll be able to push changes to your fork and ask for them to be
pulled into the main repository.</p>

<p><strong>Note for C++ Unix users</strong>: if you use Git, you will
need some GNU tools that usually only developers use, and which are
not required to build QuantLib from released tarballs. These are
automake, autoconf, libtool, GNU m4, GNU make, and others which might
escape me now. They all come with recent GNU/Linux distributions.</p>
<p>To begin the build process from a Git working copy, start
with:</p>
<pre>
sh ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>which will prepare the package for compilation. You can then use
<em>./configure</em> and <em>make</em> in the usual way.</p>

<h3>Git commit messages</h3>
If you want to stay abreast of the latest changes in the repository, GitHub provides an RSS feed which is updated each time a commit is made; you can subscribe at <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib/commits/master.atom">https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib/commits/master.atom</a>.
