<h1>QuEP 8: fixing copy behavior in the Observer class</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The copy constructor and assignment operators of the
<tt>Patterns::Observer</tt> class are currently the default ones
provided by the compiler. However, this can lead to incomplete
state in the copied object and it therefore inadequate for
<tt>Observer</tt> functionality.</p>
<p>An implementation of such methods is proposed which fixes the
problem and leads to increased security against
<tt>Observer</tt>/<tt>Observable</tt> lifetime issues.</p>
<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<pre>
class Observer {
  public:
    virtual ~Observer() {}
    virtual void update() = 0;
};

class Observable {
  public:
    virtual ~Observable() {}
    // Observer management
    virtual void registerObserver(Observer*);
    virtual void unregisterObserver(Observer*);
    void registerObservers(std::set&lt;Observer*&gt;&amp;);
    virtual void unregisterObserver(Observer*);
    void unregisterObservers(std::set&lt;Observer*&gt;&amp;);
    virtual void unregisterAll();
    std::set&lt;Observer*&gt; observers() const;
    // Observer notification
    virtual void notifyObservers();
  private:
    std::set&lt;Observer*&gt; theObservers;
};
</pre>
<p>It can be seen from a number of glitches in the above interfaces
that I was young and not very wise when I implemented this classes.
Such glitches will be outlined later together with proposed
fixes.</p>
<p>However, the most important problem here is the lack of a copy
constructor and an assignment operator for <tt>Observer</tt>. The
problem is evident in the following code snippet:</p>
<pre>
class SampleObserver : public Observer {
  public:
    void update() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "I felt a disturbance in the Force"
                  &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
};

SampleObserver obiwan;
theForce.registerObserver(&amp;obiwan); // this expands to
                                    // theForce.observers().insert(&amp;obiwan);

SampleObserver clone = obiwan;      // clone is not registered with theForce
                                    // so it is not an exact copy of obiwan

obiwan = SampleObserver();          // obiwan is still registered so it
                                    // is not a newly initialized instance
</pre>
<p>This problem did not present itself yet because of the fact that
classes derived from <tt>Observer</tt> such as <tt>Instrument</tt>
or <tt>TermStructure</tt> are usually contained into
<tt>Handle</tt>s. This implies that observers are passed by
reference rather than by value, so that copy constructors and
assignment operators are never invoked.</p>
<p>However, implementations of the latter should be written which
provide the right behavior. Such implementations are proposed in
the following section.</p>
<h3>Other glitches</h3>
<p>Public methods are provided which pass an <tt>Observable</tt>
raw pointers to <tt>Observer</tt> for storing. This can lead to
crashes should an <tt>Observer</tt> be deleted before the
<tt>Observables</tt> it registered with.</p>
<p>The <tt>Observable::notifyObservers</tt> has public visibility.
However, notification should be managed by the observables
themselves. Therefore, protected visibility would be a better
choice. The same is true for the <tt>Observable::observers</tt>
method.</p>
<p>Registration and unregistration of observers must be both
performed manually. It is left to the programmer to synchronize the
two operations, most often by remembering to unregister an
<tt>Observer</tt> before it gets destroyed. This also means that he
must keep track of the <tt>Observable</tt>s with which the
registration was done. Automatic unregistration would be safer
besides relieving the programmer from the outlined tasks.</p>
<p>A <tt>std::set</tt> is used for storing <tt>Observer</tt>s. This
was chosen so that an observer which registered twice with the same
observable would receive only one notification. However,
registering twice and unregistering once would result in being
unregistered altogether. Often, this is not the desired
behavior.</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>Registration and unregistration should be driven from the
<tt>Observer</tt> class. This would allow <tt>Observer</tt>
instances to keep track of the <tt>Observable</tt>s they registered
with, automatically unregister with them before being destroyed,
and implement correct copy behavior.</p>
<p>The new implementation is outlined in the following
pseudo-code:</p>
<pre>
class Observable {
    friend class Observer;      // this allows Observer to drive the process
  public:
    virtual ~Observable() {}
  protected:
    virtual void notifyObservers();   // used by derived classes only
  private:
    // Observer management...
    virtual void registerObserver(Observer*);
    virtual void unregisterObserver(Observer*);
    // ...and storage.
    std::list&lt;Observer*&gt; observers_;
};

class Observer {
  public:
    Observer() {}   // default constructor does nothing
    // copy constructor
    Observer(const Observer&amp; o)
    : observables_(o.observables_) {
        for (each observable in observables_)
            observable-&gt;registerObserver(this);
    }
    // assignment operator
    Observer&amp; operator=(const Observer&amp; o) {
        for (each observable in own observables_)
            observable-&gt;unregisterObserver(this);
        observables_ = o.observables_;
        for (each observable in observables_)
            observable-&gt;registerObserver(this);
    }
    // destructor with automatic unregistration
    virtual ~Observer() {
        for (each observable in own observables_)
            observable-&gt;unregisterObserver(this);
    }
    // users will call this instead of the private Observable methods
    void registerWith(Handle&lt;Observable&gt; h) {
        store h in observables_;
        h-&gt;registerObserver(this);
    }
    // this is provided in case a user wants to manually unregister
    // before the end of the Observer lifetime
    void unregisterWith(Handle&lt;Observable&gt; h) {
        h-&gt;unregisterObserver(this);
        remove h from observables_;
    }
    // to be implemented by derived classes
    virtual void update() = 0;
  private:
    // Observables are kept track of.
    std::list&lt;Handle&lt;Observable&gt; &gt; observables_;
};
</pre>
<p>This implementation solves all the outlined problems,
namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy behavior is correct. Copies of an <tt>Observer</tt> are
registered to the <tt>Observables</tt> the original one registered
with.</li>
<li><tt>Observable</tt> methods still take raw <tt>Observer</tt>
pointers. However, such methods are now private and registration is
handled by means of the <tt>Observer</tt>s which will unregister
themselves before being destroyed. This makes it impossible for
<tt>Observable</tt>s to access a deallocated pointer. Also, it must
be noted that storing raw pointers is necessary because storing
handles would lead to a circular reference preventing both
<tt>Observer</tt> and <tt>Observable</tt> from ever being
destroyed.</li>
<li><tt>Observable::notifyObservers</tt> is now protected and
accessible by derived classes only.</li>
<li>Unregistration of an <tt>Observer</tt> being destroyed is now
automatic. It is no longer necessary for the programmer to
unregister with <tt>Observable</tt>s in classes derived from
<tt>Observer</tt>. This will often result in removing the need for
a destructor altogether, i.e., in less code to maintain.</li>
<li>A <tt>std::list</tt> is now used for storing
<tt>Observer</tt>s. This will cause an observer which registered
twice and unregistered once with the same observer to be still
registered.</li>
</ul>
