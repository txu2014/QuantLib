<h1>QuEP 7: using the Visitor pattern to avoid interface bloat</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A technique is here proposed which allows one to specialize
calculations on a per-derived-class basis without increasing the
number of virtual member functions in the base class interface.</p>
<p>Such technique consists in the usage of the Visitor pattern
which is shortly outlined together with possible applications to
the existing class hierarchies.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It has been argued [1] that functionalities that can be
implemented by means of the public interface of a class should be
made available as a non-friend, non-member function rather than
another method of the class. This actually improves encapsulation
since this enlarged class interface (meant as the set of the class
methods and the additional non-member functions) is thus made less
dependent on the class internals.</p>
<p>However, there are situations where this simple approach would
not be convenient, either because knowledge of the exact type of
the instance is actually needed, or because it would prevent the
developer from applying useful optimizations depending on the
instance type.</p>
<p>An example of the first case is a number of report
functionalities which can be desired for the <tt>CashFlow</tt>
hierarchy. Derived classes include simple cash flows whose amount
is fixed or accrued coupons which in turn can be paid based on a
fixed or a floating rate. For each of the latter types, whether the
amount of the cashflow was already fixed or the extent of its
basis-point sensitivity can be determined based entirely on their
public interface, as shown in the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre>
procedure WasFixed(CashFlow)
    case SimpleCashFlow:
        return true
    case FixedRateCoupon:
        return true
    case FloatingRateCoupon:
        if today &gt; fixingDate()
            return true
        else
            return false

procedure BPS(CashFlow,TermStructure)
    case SimpleCashFlow:
        no such thing
    case Coupon:
        return nominal()*accrualPeriod()*discount(date())
</pre>
<p>The above could be naturally implemented as virtual member
functions. However, a number of such functionalities could be found
which would end up bloating the base <tt>CashFlow</tt> interface,
and the more so should the hierarchy be extended with more complex
coupons. Moreover, functionalities which make sense only for part
of the hierarchy should not be exposed by the <tt>CashFlow</tt>
interface.</p>
<p>An example of the second case is a number of calculations which
could be performed on term structures. For instance, one might want
to know the average of the instantaneous forward rate over a given
period in order to feed it to an option pricer. According to the
definition of zero yield rate, this could be implemented as
(pseudo-code again):</p>
<pre>
procedure averageForward(TermStructure,Time t0,Time t1)
    return (t1*zeroYield(t1)-t0*zeroYield(t0))/(t1-t0)
</pre>
<p>This would be the optimal choice for a term structure which can
calculate zero yields directly. However, if the latter were
calculated by integrating the instantaneous forward rates, the
above would be highly inefficient: the integral from 0 to t1 would
be calculated twice, only to be canceled out by the subtraction. In
this case, one would be better off calculating the integral from t0
to t1 himself. But in turn, this would be highly inefficient if the
term structure were of the first kind---one which can calculate
zero yields efficiently. Optimizations should clearly be done on a
per-class basis. Again, this could be achieved by means of virtual
functions. However, it would lead to interface bloat as more and
more such functionalities are requested.</p>
<p>The solution would be a dispatch mechanism, other than virtual
functions, which can call the appropriate external function for the
given instance type without resorting to dynamic casts.</p>
<h2>The Visitor pattern</h2>
<p>The Visitor pattern [2,3] is a double-dispatch mechanism which
allows one to specialize a function on a per-base class without
modifying the original base class interface. The pattern structure
is shown in the following diagram for the <tt>CashFlow</tt> class.
However, it applies unchanged to any other hierarchy.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep007/quep007.png" width="959" height="341"
alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>The only addition to the base class interface consist of an
abstract <tt>acceptVisitor</tt> method which takes a
<tt>CashFlowVisitor</tt>. The latter is an abstract class whose
interface consist of a number of <tt>visitXXX</tt> methods, each
one corresponding to a derived cash flow class and each one taking
an instance of the corresponding <em>derived</em> type. Finally,
each class derived from <tt>CashFlow</tt> implements
<tt>acceptVisitor</tt> by passing itself to the right
<tt>visit</tt> method of the passed visitor.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how this implementation allows one to dispatch
a generic method call to the desired method specialization
depending on the actual cash flow type. Its usage is the
following:</p>
<pre>
Handle&lt;CashFlow&gt; cashFlow;      // (1)
WasFixedVisitor v;
cashFlow-&gt;acceptVisitor(v);     // (2)
bool fixed = v.wasFixed();      // (3)
</pre>
<p>(1) Let's say for the sake of explanation that this handle
points to a <tt>FloatingRateCoupon</tt>. However, the latter is
stored as an upcasted pointer to <tt>CashFlow</tt>.</p>
<p>(2) This method call triggers the virtual method dispatch
mechanism, so that <tt>FloatingRateCoupon::acceptVisitor</tt> is
executed. In turn, the latter calls
<tt>WasFixed::visitFloatingRateCoupon</tt> and passes it a
reference to the coupon <em>as a floating-rate coupon</em>. The
called visitor method can then use the full
<tt>FloatingRateCoupon</tt> interface to calculate the result
rather than the base class interface only.</p>
<p>(3) The result is retrieved from the visitor. Such result could
not be returned directly from <tt>CashFlow::acceptVisitor</tt>
since the result type depends on the particular <tt>Visitor</tt>
subclass, while the return type of <tt>acceptVisitor</tt> must be
fully determined in the <tt>CashFlow</tt> interface. The solution
is to have both <tt>acceptVisitor</tt> and the <tt>visitXXX</tt>
methods return <tt>void</tt> and to have the latter methods store
the result in a data member of the visitor, which can be of the
desired type.</p>
<p>Finally, it can be noted that a variant of the Visitor pattern
exists which is called Acyclic Visitor pattern [4]. It is based on
the same principle, while addressing issues such as the mutual
compilation dependency of <tt>CashFlow</tt>,
<tt>CashFlowVisitor</tt> and all the <tt>CashFlow</tt> subclasses.
The acyclic visitor is better suited for use in systems where the
interested hierarchy is supposed to grow in time, which is the case
in QuantLib. It also allows to express more naturally the case in
which it makes only sense to apply a given visitor to a limited
subset of the hierarchy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Visitor pattern was proposed for use in the QuantLib
library. Such pattern allows one to effectively add virtual
behavior to a function without making it a member of the interested
class, thus avoiding interface bloat and improving
encapsulation.</p>
<p>The Acyclic Visitor pattern is also proposed. The latter adds a
bit of complexity to the Visitor implementation but effectively
addresses a few shortcomings of the original pattern. The choice
between the two patterns will hopefully made more clear by future
discussion of this proposal.</p>
