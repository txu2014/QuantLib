<h1>QuEP 2: reimplementing boundary conditions for FD models</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Boundary conditions (BC) are an essential part of a
finite-difference model.</p>
<p>In the current implementation, BC:s are implemented as a simple
structure with a enumerated type tag and a value. The logic of the
boundary condition itself is implemented in the TridiagonalOperator
class. This has drawbacks in terms of both model logic and
extensibility.</p>
<p>A new implementation is proposed which encapsulates the logic of
the BC into a polymorphic BoundaryCondition class which is part of
the finite-difference model as much as the differential operator
and the time scheme.</p>
<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<p>The present implementation of FiniteDifferenceMethod contains an
Evolver, which in turn contains an Operator. BC:s are set to the
operator before the latter is passed to the model which in turn
passes it to the evolver. Setting a BC immediately modifies an
operator; also, BC:s are stored in the operator and applied to the
input and/or output array when the applyTo() or solveFor() methods
are invoked.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<p>There is no clean encapsulation of the BC logic. The operator
and the input/output arrays are modified at different times and
different places in the code. Also, there is no clear separation
between the BC logic and the linear algebra calculations which form
the core of the applyTo() and solveFor() methods.</p>
<p>The code which applies the BC:s is a switch construct which
executes different code depending on the enumerated BC type tag.
This seriously compromises the extensibility of the code, e.g., the
addition of new BC types to the framework.</p>
<p>Another logic flaw is present, namely, BC:s are set and
modifications are applied to the operator D which is passed to the
model. Instead, they should only be applied to the operator which
transforms the array at a given time step into the array at the
next step. Such operator is not D itself but rather I+dt*D or a
similar one depending on the chosen time scheme. For this same
reason, care must be taken that the implementation of the operator
algebra propagates the BC:s from D to (dt*D) to (I+(dt*D)).</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>A polymorphic BoundaryCondition class is defined which
encapsulates the BC logic. Its interface is defined so that it
should be able to manage different kind of required modifications,
namely, ones that should be applied before and/or after the
application of the operator or its inverse. Such methods act
simultaneously on the operator and the right-hand side of the
equation. Also, a setTime() interface is provided which allows to
manage time-dependent BC:s.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep002/quep002b.png" width="674" height=
"446" alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>The BC:s are passed to the model together with the operator and
are stored into the evolver. It is the responsibility of the
evolver to call the appropriate BC methods inside its step()
method.</p>
<p>Finally, the TridiagonalOperator would not be concerned with
BC:s. Its applyTo() and solveFor() methods would only implement the
corresponding linear algebra calculations.</p>
<p>The framework would be implemented as in the following
pseudo-code:</p>
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator&amp; L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : evolver_(L,boundaryConditions) { ... }
    ...
  private:
    Evolver evolver_;
};

class ExplicitEuler {
  public:
    ExplicitEuler(const Operator&amp; L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array&amp; a, Time t) {
        ... // call L.setTime(t) if needed
        // actual operator is O = I-dt*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.setTime(t);
            bc.applyBeforeApplying(O);
        a = O.applyTo(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterApplying(a);
    }
};

class ImplicitEuler {
  public:
    ImplicitEuler(const Operator&amp; L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array&amp; a, Time t) {
        ... // call L.setTime(t-dt) if needed
        // actual operator is O = I+dt*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.setTime(t-dt);
            bc.applyBeforeSolving(O,a);
        a = O.solveFor(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterSolving(a);
    }
};

class CrankNicolson {
  public:
    CrankNicolson(const Operator&amp; L, ??? boundaryConditions)
    : L_(L), boundaryConditions_(boundaryConditions) { ... }
    void step(Array&amp; a, Time t) {
        ... // call L.setTime(t) if needed
        // actual operators are O1 = I-(dt/2)*L and O2 = I+(dt/2)*L
        for every boundary condition
            bc.setTime(t);
            bc.applyBeforeApplying(O1);
        a = O1.applyTo(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterApplying(a);

        for every boundary condition
            bc.setTime(t-dt);
            bc.applyBeforeSolving(O2,a);
        a = O2.solveFor(a);
        for every boundary condition
            bc.applyAfterSolving(a);
    }
};
</pre>
<p>The missing piece in the above code concerns the way to pass the
BC:s to a model. This must take into account that we do not know in
advance their number even in 1-D models, much less in 2-D or
higher.</p>
<p>One possibility would be to pass a container of BC:s, e.g., a
std::vector or a std::list. In this case, the constructor of a
model would be implemented as</p>
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator&amp; L,
                           const std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt; &gt;&amp; bc)
    : evolver_(L,bc) { ... }
    ...
};
</pre>
<p>Another would be to pass to the model one BC which represents
the set of all BC:s which are local to a part of the solution. The
Composite pattern could be used to define such set as</p>
<pre>
class CompositeBC : public BoundaryCondition {
  public:
    CompositeBC(const std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt; &gt;&amp; bc =
                std::list&lt;Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt; &gt;())
    : bc_(bc) {}
    void add(const Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt;&amp; c) {
        bc_.push_back(c);
    }
    void setTime(Time t) {
        for (every BC in the list)
            i-&gt;setTime(t);
    }
    void applyBeforeApplying(Operator&amp; O) {
        for (every BC in the list)
            i-&gt;applyBeforeApplying(O);
    }
    ...
};
</pre>
<p>In this case, the constructor of a model would be implemented
as:</p>
<pre>
class FiniteDifferenceMethod {
  public:
    FiniteDifferenceMethod(const Operator&amp; L,
                           const Handle&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt;&amp; bc)
    : evolver_(L,bc) { ... }
    ...
};
</pre>
