<h1>QuEP 5: using replaceable pricing engines in option
implementations</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A number of pricers are currently implemented in QuantLib which
provide option evaluation services. However, they all inhabit a
sort of middle abstraction layer between high-level objects such as
<tt>Instrument</tt> and low-level facilities such as
<tt>FiniteDifferenceModel</tt> or <tt>MonteCarloModel</tt>. This
leads to mixing of concerns, loss of abstraction, and a number of
unrelated class hierarchies. In turn, this leads me to fear that
such hierarchies would be difficult to maintain. Fear leads to
Anger. Anger leads to Hate. Hate leads to Suffering.</p>
<p>An implementation of Option classes is proposed which tries to
address the above problems (well, except for the Jedi part). In
particular, an <tt>Option</tt> class is introduced in the
<tt>Instrument</tt> hierarchy which serves as base for concrete
option instruments. In turn, the latter are decoupled from their
actual pricing model by means of an abstract
<tt>OptionPricingEngine</tt> class whose child classes encapsulate
the different available choices for option calculation.</p>
<h2>Current implementation</h2>
<p>The figure below shows a partial sketch of the current QuantLib
architecture.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep005/quep005a.png" width="823" height=
"349" alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>The abstract <tt>Instrument</tt> class serves as base class for
actual financial instruments. It uses the
<em>Observer/Observable</em> pattern to determine whether its value
needs to be recalculated due to changes in market parameters. Also,
it uses the <em>Framework</em> pattern to hide such caching logic
from derived classes---the latter only need to provide a
<tt>performCalculation</tt> method which implements the actual
calculations.</p>
<p>However, the currently available option pricers do not take
advantage of such machinery. Instead, distinct hierarchies of
pricers are implemented among which are the two shown above,
namely, one derived from <tt>SingleAssetOption</tt> which includes
analytical and finite-difference option pricers, and one derived
from <tt>McPricer</tt> which includes Monte Carlo option
pricers.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<p>Option classes are tightly coupled with their calculation model.
For instance, three unrelated European option classes are shown in
the above diagram which are dependent on the used model (analytic,
finite-difference, or Monte Carlo) and do not share any common
"European option" abstraction.</p>
<p>Separate hierarchies are implemented which are not related and
would not be easily integrated with the <tt>Instrument</tt>
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Housekeeping code had to be implemented again in
<tt>SingleAssetOption</tt> for the caching of calculated results
instead of reusing the code already available in
<tt>Instrument</tt>. Also, separating the class hierarchies led to
the duplication of data members in <tt>SingleAssetOption</tt> and
<tt>McEuropean</tt>.</p>
<p>Option pricers take their parameters (e.g., the underlying
price, the risk-free rate, etc.) as <tt>double</tt>s even though
such values will be obtained from more complex classes such as
<tt>MarketElement</tt>s or <tt>TermStructure</tt>s. Using the
pricers requires to repeatedly write the code for obtaining the
required scalar values.</p>
<p>The inner status of a given pricer should not be modified by an
implied volatility calculation. Therefore, a temporary copy of the
pricer must be obtained whose parameters (namely, the volatility of
the underlying price) can be modified. This requires every pricer
class to implement both a <tt>clone()</tt> method which returns a
copy of itself of the right type and a <tt>setVolatility()</tt>
method for manually changing the parameters of the copy.</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>The proposed implementation of the option pricing framework is
shown in the following diagram.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="quep005/quep005b.png" width="819" height=
"422" alt="UML diagram"></div>
<p>An <tt>Option</tt> class is introduced which inherits from
<tt>Instrument</tt>. Such class contains a pricing engine to which
calculations are delegated.</p>
<p>An abstract <tt>OptionPricingEngine</tt> class acts as a base
class for calculation engines. Such class provides abstract methods
for setting the calculation parameters, validating the latter, and
getting calculation results.</p>
<p>Two abstract classes <tt>Arguments</tt> and <tt>Results</tt> are
introduced. Such classes are empty and have the purpose of defining
a single base type for calculation parameters and results,
respectively. Also, a number of derived classes is provided which
group together different sets of related parameters and results.
Such classes have no methods and are simple structures which allow
unrestricted access to their data members. No other interface is
needed since their only purpose is to pack together data to be
passed to and returned from the engine.</p>
<p>Concrete engines contain the appropriate structures containing
their required parameters and provided results. Such structures are
assembled by multiply inheriting from the available Arguments and
Results subclasses. For instance, parameters and results for an
European option engine could be declared as:</p>
<pre>
class EuropeanOptionParameters : public OptionParameters,
                                 public UnderlyingParameters,
                                 public MarketParameters {};

class EuropeanOptionResults : public OptionValue,
                              public OptionGreeks {};

class EuropeanEngine : public OptionPricingEngine {
  private:
    EuropeanOptionParameters parameters_;
    EuropeanOptionResults results_;
  public:
    Arguments* parameters() { return &amp;parameters_; }
    Results* results() { return &amp;results_; }
    ...
};
</pre>
<p><tt>Option</tt> implements the <tt>Instrument</tt> interface by
delegating the parameter passing to its subclasses and the
calculation to the contained engine. Its
<tt>performCalculations</tt> method can be implemented as:</p>
<pre>
void Option::performCalculations() const {

    // the method below is purely virtual
    // implementation is delegated to derived classes
    setupEngine();

    // sanity check and calculations are delegated to the engine:
    // this checks the values in the Arguments struct...
    engine_-&gt;validateParameters();
    // .. and this calculates and store results in the Results struct
    engine_-&gt;calculate();

    // get the results:
    // Option only needs to fulfill Instrument requirements, i.e.,
    // set the NPV value.

    // downcast the Results struct to the appropriate type...
    const OptionValue* results =
        dynamic_cast&lt;const OptionValue*&gt;(engine_-&gt;results());
    // ... check that the cast succeeded...
    QL_ENSURE(results != 0, "results do not contain an option value slot");
    // ... and read the results.
    NPV_ = results-&gt;value;

}
</pre>
<p>Concrete options will contain objects such as
<tt>MarketElement</tt>s, <tt>TermStructure</tt>s, and
<tt>Date</tt>s. It will be their job to deduce from such objects
the appropriate value for the engine parameters. Such logic will be
implemented in the <tt>setupEngine</tt> methods. For instance, an
European option could implement the latter as:</p>
<pre>
class EuropeanOption : public Option {
  private:
    RelinkableHandle&lt;TermStructure&gt; riskFreeCurve_;
    RelinkableHandle&lt;MarketElement&gt; underlyingValue_;
    RelinkableHandle&lt;MarketElement&gt; underlyingVol_;
    Date exerciseDate_;
    ...
};

void EuropeanOption::setupEngine() const {

    // downcast the Arguments struct to the appropriate type...
    UnderlyingParams* underArgs =
        dynamic_cast&lt;UnderlyingParams*&gt;(engine_-&gt;parameters());
    QL_ENSURE(underArgs != 0, ...);
    // ... and set the values
    underArgs-&gt;value = underlyingValue_-&gt;value();
    underArgs-&gt;volatility = underlyingVol_-&gt;value();

    // do the same for other parameter sets:
    MarketParams* marketArgs =
        dynamic_cast&lt;marketParams*&gt;(engine_-&gt;parameters());
    ...
    marketArgs-&gt;riskFreeRate = riskFreeCurve_-&gt;discount(exerciseDate_);

    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Also, additional results can be read from the engine by
extending the base <tt>performCalculation</tt> method:</p>
<pre>
void EuropeanOption::performCalculations() const {

    // the main logic is in the parent class method
    Option::performCalculations();

    // now read additional results
    const OptionGreeks* results =
        dynamic_cast&lt;const OptionGreeks*&gt;(engine_-&gt;results());
    QL_ENSURE(...);
    delta_ = results-&gt;delta;
    gamma_ = results-&gt;gamma;
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, it can be noted that implied volatility calculations
can be performed by feeding the engine different volatility values
and analyzing the returned option value. This does not modify the
inner state of the option, since previous results were already
stored in its own variables and will not be recalculated until the
<tt>Instrument</tt> machinery assesses the need to do so. This
eliminates the need for cloning the option.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A new implementation of the option pricing framework was
proposed which addresses the disadvantages of the current
implementation, namely:</p>
<p>decoupling of option classes from calculation is achieved by
encapsulating the latter into a pricing engine; an option class can
be abstracted from its calculation model and instantiated by
passing the latter, as in:</p>
<pre>
Handle&lt;OptionPricingEngine&gt; engine1(new AnalyticEuropeanEngine()),
                            engine2(new FDEuropeanEngine(timeSteps)),
                            engine3(new MCEuropeanEngine(samples));

EuropeanOption opt1(..., engine1);
EuropeanOption opt2(..., engine2);
EuropeanOption opt3(..., engine3);
</pre>
<p>integration of options into the <tt>Instrument</tt> hierarchy is
achieved;</p>
<p>separation of concerns is achieved by delegating housekeeping
and result caching to <tt>Instrument</tt>, market data storage and
interpretation to concrete options, and calculation to pricing
engines; this also eliminates code duplication;</p>
<p>passing of high-level abstractions such as
<tt>MarketElement</tt>s and <tt>TermStructure</tt>s is achieved;
their interpretation is performed independently of the calculation
model;</p>
<p>implied volatility calculation is performed internally by the
option, independently of the calculation model and partly of the
option class; no cloning of the option is required.</p>
<h2>Proof of concept</h2>
A rough proof of concept is available in the library. The base
classes are implemented, as well as an analytic European engine and
a concrete option class by the unsatisfactory name of
<tt>PlainOption</tt>. The implementation can be found in the
following files:
<ul>
<li>ql/argsandresults.hpp</li>
<li>ql/option.hpp</li>
<li>ql/option.cpp</li>
<li>ql/Pricers/europeanengine.hpp</li>
<li>ql/Pricers/europeanengine.cpp</li>
<li>ql/Instruments/vanillaoption.hpp</li>
<li>ql/Instruments/vanillaoption.cpp</li>
</ul>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
