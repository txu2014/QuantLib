<h1>QuEP 9: generic disposable objects</h1>
<div class="center">Luigi Ballabio</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A generalization of <a href="quep004.html">QuEP 4</a> is
proposed which allows one to create temporary objects with small
return-by-copy footprint.</p>
<h2>Proposed implementation</h2>
<p>A temporary array class was proposed in <a href=
"quep004.html">QuEP 4</a> which reduced the abstraction penalty
related to returning temporary objects by copy. The analysis of
such penalty and the mechanism used by the temporary array are not
repeated here.</p>
<p>Rather, a generalization of such mechanism is introduced which
allows it to be used with predefined types such as
<tt>std::vector</tt>, albeit not to its full extent. Also,
user-defined types can easily be modified so that they can take
full advantage of this facility. Such modifications are purely
additive, so that existing code would continue to work
unaffected.</p>
<p>Such generalization is encapsulated in a template
<tt>Temporary</tt> class which inherits from its template argument
and redefines its copy constructor and assignment operator so that
the instance contents are swapped rather than copied, as shown in
the following implementation:</p>
<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class Temporary : public T {                // Temporary is-a T
  public:
    // constructors
    Temporary() {}
    Temporary(const T&amp; t) : T(t) {}         // deep copy as usual
    Temporary(Temporary&amp; t) { swap(t); }    // swap this with t
    // assignment operators
    Temporary&amp; operator=(const T&amp; t) {
        T::operator=(t);                    // deep copy as usual
        return *this;
    }
    Temporary&amp; operator=(Temporary&amp; t) {
        swap(t);                            // swap this with t
        return *this;
    }
};
</pre>
<p>The above implementation relies on <tt>T</tt> exposing a method
<tt>swap(T&amp;)</tt> which swaps the contents of <tt>this</tt> and
of the passed instance. Also, <tt>T</tt> must be assignable and
have a default constructor. All such requirements are satisfied by
all STL containers (see section 23.1 of the ANSI/ISO C++ standard)
so that functions returning such types by value can benefit from
the use of <tt>Temporary</tt>. For instance, a function implemented
and called as:</p>
<pre>
std::vector&lt;double&gt; f(...) {
    std::vector&lt;double&gt; result;
    // calculate result
    return result;
}

std::vector&lt;double&gt; v = f(...);
</pre>
implicitly performs three memory allocations and two copies of the
vector elements (see QuEP 4 for details). Simply rewriting it as:
<pre>
Temporary&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; f(...) {
    Temporary&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; result;
    // calculate result
    return result;
}

std::vector&lt;double&gt; v = f(...);
</pre>
reduces the count to two allocations and one copy. In this case, we
cannot do better since we cannot add to <tt>std::vector</tt> a new
copy constructor taking a temporary.<br>
<br>
<p>For user-defined classes, this technique can be fully exploited
by adding to such classes a <tt>swap</tt> method and by overloading
copy constructor and assignment operator, as in:</p>
<pre>
class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass();
    ... // other constructors
    MyClass(Temporary&lt;MyClass&gt;&amp; x) { swap(x); }
    // the same for assignment operator
    ... // other methods
    void swap(MyClass&amp; x) { swap data members }
    ...
};
</pre>
This addition does not affect existing code and allows one to write
and invoke functions as:
<pre>
Temporary&lt;MyClass&gt; f(...) {
    Temporary&lt;MyClass&gt; result;
    // calculate result
    return result;
}

MyClass x = f(...);
</pre>
Due to the overloading of <tt>MyClass::operator=</tt>, the cost of
the above reduces to the allocation implied in the construction of
the result. No further allocation or copy is performed.<br>
<br>
<h3>A note on constructors</h3>
<p>It must be noted that since constructors are not inherited,
<tt>Temporary&lt;T&gt;</tt> does not have any particular
constructor which <tt>T</tt> might implement besides the default
one.</p>
<p>For instance, it would not be possible to write:</p>
<pre>
size_t size = 10;
Temporary&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; a(size);
</pre>
since such constructor is not available. The above should instead
be written:
<pre>
size_t size = 10;
Temporary&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; a;
a.resize(size);
</pre>
This also means that for <tt>Temporary&lt;T&gt;</tt> to be used,
<tt>T</tt> must provide the means to incrementally construct a
default-initialized <tt>T</tt> instance. E.g., for
<tt>Temporary&lt;Array&gt;</tt> to be used, a <tt>resize</tt>
method should be added to <tt>Array</tt>'s public interface which
is not currently available.<br>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>An implementation of generic disposable objects was proposed
which reduces the abstraction penalty related to return-by-copy
semantics. The presented technique can be successfully applied to
both STL classes and used-defined types, the latter taking the most
advantage of this penalty reduction.</p>
