<c>General questions
<q>Is it OK to email a QuantLib developer to ask questions, or seek
   help, or report a bug?
<a>Well, it's not a crime.  However, we urge you to consider posting
   to the QuantLib mailing list instead.  Messages on the list are
   stored, and thus benefit the whole project: the next user with your
   problem will be able to find the answer by searching the archives.
   Moreover, the developers can volunteer only a limited time; thus,
   they will employ such time to answer questions on the list (which
   serves the project) rather than doing private tutoring for free.
   They are likely to answer you "please, post your question on the
   mailing list" anyway. They might even refer you to this FAQ entry.

<c>General questions
<q>How should I report a bug?
<a>You can file a bug report using the <a
   href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12740&amp;atid=112740">
   SourceForge interface</a>, or you could write to a QuantLib mailing
   list.

   In any case please report as much details as possible.

   If it is a compilation problem please state at least:
   <ul>
   <li>operating system;</li>
   <li>compiler (version number, patch level, etc.);</li>
   <li>Boost version;</li>
   <li>the compilation error and the file affected;</li>
   </ul>

   If the test suite fails please report the output obtained by executing the
   test suite with the following command line options:
   <pre>
   --log_level=messages --build_info=yes --result_code=no --report_level=short
   </pre>

<c>General questions
<q>Thanks for this project. How can I give back to it?

<a>In true open-source fashion, you can contribute code to the
   project; see the 'Contributing to the project' section below. This
   is by far the preferred contribution, closely followed by using the
   library intensively and reporting any bugs you might find---and
   possibly patches for fixing them.

   <br>
   However, if you made money by using QuantLib and feel that, as
   Christmas is getting near, you want to give us a token of your
   gratitude---well, who am I to discourage you? (for instance, &lt;
   grin &gt; Luigi's wish list on Amazon UK is <a
   href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/2PC411P4U28CG/ref=wl_em_to">here</a>,
   and Nando's is <a
   href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/Q94W7HUR49Z5/ref=wl_em_to">here</a>.)

<c>General questions
<q>Amazon Wish List? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
<a>&lt; broad grin &gt; No, we aren't.

<c>Contributing to the project
<q>I'm interested in getting involved with the project. What should
   I do?

<a> There are many ways in which you can help the project. You can
    read our <a
    href="http://quantlib.org/newdeveloper.shtml">developer
    introduction</a> for more information.

<c>Contributing to the project
<q>How do I contribute code to the project?

<a>First of all, make sure that contributing code on your part cannot
   result in litigation about intellectual property. If you work at
   some financial institution, ask for permission before contributing
   any relevant portion of code---and get a statement in print.

   <br>
   As for the mechanics of contribution, the preferred way by far is to
   submit a pull request on GitHub.

   <br>
   If you're not comfortable with that, you can submit a patch to the <a
   href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12740&amp;atid=312740">
   SourceForge patch tracker</a>.  This will make it less likely that
   your files are forgotten in the depths of a developer's mailbox.

   <br>
   The preferred format is a diff file as created by the 'patch'
   utility.  If possible, send differences against the current master
   code base available in the Git repository;
   diff files based on the latest release might not apply to the
   latest sources.

   <br>
   If 'patch' is not available on your system or you are not familiar
   with it, submit the modified files. However, keep in mind that
   integrating such a contribution will require more work and
   therefore will take longer.

   <br>
   Finally, contributions should be accompanied by one or more test
   cases checking the functionality of the new code. While this is not
   a strict requirement, complying with it will buy from the
   developers a lot more sympathy towards your contribution.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>I'm having trouble building Boost.
<a>If you're using Visual C++ 7.1 or later, you don't need to build
   Boost: an installer for precompiled binaries is available <a
   href="http://www.boost-consulting.com/download.html">here</a>
   (note, though, that it was reported not to work through a proxy
   server.)

   <br>
   If you're using another compiler (or you are, alas, behind a proxy
   server) you can ask for help on the QuantLib mailing list. However,
   you'll probably get better help from the <a
   href="http://boost.org/more/mailing_lists.htm#users">Boost mailing
   list</a> since the Boost people have much better expertise in
   troubleshooting their libraries than we have.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>I'm having trouble building QuantLib with MinGW.
<a>I suggest you use Dev-C++ or the free VC++ Express instead.
   Anyway, some guidance can be found
   <a href="http://blog.fosstrading.com/2010/12/build-rquantlib-on-32-bit-windows.html">here</a>;
   the steps to build QuantLib are those from 1 to 5.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>When building QuantLib, I get a compile error about a missing
   boost/something header.
<a>As mentioned in the readme, QuantLib depends on the Boost library
   (<a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>). You must
   download and install it before building QuantLib. After
   installation, you might have to setup your IDE so that the Boost
   headers are in its include path.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>When building the test-suite, I encounter a linking error about
   libboost_unit_test_framework-xxx.
<a>The folder including the Boost libraries in not in your link path.
   See the documentation of your compiler for instructions on how to
   add it.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>But I have no such library on my machine!
<a>Most likely, you downloaded the Boost distribution and just copied
   its header files somewhere in your include path. The Boost
   libraries must be built as well; see <a
   href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html">here</a> for
   instructions.  Another possibility is that you built the libraries
   with bjam, which in later Boost releases doesn't build all
   libraries by default; you'll have to run it with the
   <tt>--build-type=complete</tt> flag.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>Ok, now I have the library; and the library path is set correctly.
   But I still cannot link!
<a>You're using Dev-C++ or MinGW, aren't you? gcc is looking for a
   library called libboost_unit_test_framework-xxx.a, but the Boost
   installation process created a libboost_unit_test_framework-xxx.lib
   instead. Make a copy of the latter in the same location and rename
   the copy so that it has the correct extension.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>I'm having trouble building QuantLib with the Sun Studio 11 compiler.
<a>If the error you're getting resembles to
   <pre>
>> Assertion:   (../lnk/init.cc, line 1032)
    while processing ../../ql/history.hpp at line 135.
*** Error code 1
   </pre>
   you need to patch your compiler. Sun makes the needed patches
   available <a
   href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/cc/downloads/patches/ss11_patches.html">here</a>;
   you need the ones labeled as "Compilers back-end" and "C++".

<c>Testing QuantLib
<q>The QuantLib test-suite fails when compiling under Mac OS X 10.3.
<a>We are aware of the problem; apparently, there are issues with
   global and/or static variables when using shared libraries. As a
   workaround, compile QuantLib as a static library. This can be
   accomplished by running configure as:
   <pre>
   configure --disable-shared
   </pre>
   This is not necessary under Mac OS X 10.4 or higher.

<c>Using QuantLib
<q>I cannot link QuantLib to my project under Visual C++
<a>If you're encountering the linking error
   <pre>
   LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file "QuantLib-vcX-xx-xxx-a_b_c.lib"
   </pre>
   the folder including QuantLib-vcX-xx-xxx-a_b_c.lib is not in your
   link path (See the menu Property Pages | Linker | Input) or you
   haven't really built QuantLib-vcX-xx-xxx-a_b_c.lib yet.  Note that
   each build configuration produces a different library.

<c>Using QuantLib
<q>Programs linking QuantLib fail to run correctly under Mac OS X 10.3.
<a>We are aware of the problem; apparently, there are issues with
   global and/or static variables when using shared libraries. As a
   workaround, compile QuantLib as a static library. This can be
   accomplished by running configure as:
   <pre>
   configure --disable-shared
   </pre>
   This is not necessary under Mac OS X 10.4 or higher.

<c>QuantLib features
<q>Why is feature X missing from QuantLib? It would be a very useful one.
<a>See the 'Contributing to the project' section in this FAQ.

<c>QuantLib extensions
<q>I'm having trouble building/using QuantLibXL or QuantLibAddin.
<a>The QuantLibAddin project has its own FAQ; see <a
   href="http://www.quantlibaddin.org/faq.html">http://www.quantlibaddin.org/faq.html</a>.

<c>QuantLib mailing lists
<q>How do I start a new topic?
<a>Use the "New message" command on your mail client; do not reply to
   another post and change the subject. Although seemingly more
   convenient for you, replying will cause your message to appear in
   the wrong thread in the mailing list archive, in the newsgroup
   interface at Gmane, and in mail clients that support threads.  This
   brings a whole lot of inconvenience on a number of
   people---possibly including you, as your message might be
   overlooked by people not interested in the original topic.

<c>QuantLib extensions
<q>Does QuantLib support .NET?
<a>Not directly. C# bindings for QuantLib are available, though; see
   the <a href="http://quantlib.org/extensions.shtml">extensions page</a>.

<c>QuantLib extensions
<q>Does QuantLib support FpML? Serialization?
<a>Not yet. The subject has been discussed in the mailing lists (look
   in the archives for the relevant threads) but no actual work has
   been done and help is needed in this area.

<c>Building QuantLib
<q>I'm having trouble building QuantLib with the Visual C++ 7.1
   compiler (a.k.a Visual C++ .NET.)
<a>If such error is
   <pre>
   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\include\vector(1112) : error C2065: '_Myoff' : undeclared identifier
   </pre>
   it is caused by the latest VC++7.1 implementation of
   <tt>std::vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt>, which compiles fine when
   Microsoft extensions are enabled, but fails to compile in
   ANSI-compliance mode (used when building QuantLib.)  You can avoid
   the error by turning off ANSI compliance in the project settings.
