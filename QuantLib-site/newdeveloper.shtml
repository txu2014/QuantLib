<h1 class="center">Developer introduction</h1>
<p>Developers willing to contribute to the QuantLib project should
<a href="http://quantlib.org/mailinglists.shtml">subscribe</a> to the
QuantLib-dev mailing list. Such list is where current and future
developments are discussed; your contribution to the discussions, even
if only an occasional one, will be useful.</p>
<p>Should you want to get more involved, there are a number of things
you can do. Possibilities include:
<ul>
<li>contribute code to the library. Submitting a patch would be the
    easiest way to get your contribution into the QuantLib code tree;
    see the <a href=
    "http://quantlib.org/faq.shtml#Contributing%20to%20the%20project1">QuantLib
    FAQ</a> for details. If you plan some non-trivial contribution,
    you may want to post a proposal to the list and discuss it before
    you start coding. It will be a very useful effort since it might
    be re-cycled as documentation when you actually implement your
    ideas.</li>
<li>answer questions on the QuantLib-users mailing list.</li>
<li><a href="http://quantlib.org/mailinglists.shtml">subscribe</a> to
    the QuantLib-cvs mailing list and review the changes committed to
    the repository. You might ask questions about the change, make
    further suggestions, or report a bug you spotted. For this
    purpose, the mailing list is set up so that replies to posts go to
    QuantLib-dev.</li>
<li>provide examples. Those are easier to write than new parts of the
    library, and are immensely useful to new users as they can act as
    documentation of library features and their usage. If you don't
    have the time to provide examples, you can still contribute by
    writing to QuantLib-dev and proposing examples to be written by
    whoever accepts the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if contributions were little, their cumulative effect would be a
great help to improve the library. Moreover, each of the above are
also ways to familiarize with the library (so that in time you'll
become able to work on its internals) and to establish yourself as a
trusted contributor. In the latter case, you might be granted write
access to the Subversion repository tree.</p>
<p>Finally, we might need to ask for a disclaimer from your employer
stating that your contribution can be released under the QuantLib
license. Such disclaimer won't be necessary if you own the copyright
of the code, but you might want to check that with your employer. An
example of such disclaimer can be downloaded <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/templates/disclaimer.rtf">here</a>, but you can
write your own along the same lines if the wording doesn't suit your
employer.</p>
