<!-- section 1 General -->
<h1><a name="general" id="general"></a>1. General</h1>
<h3><a name="g1" id="g1"></a>1.1.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: What is SourceForge.net?<br>
A:</strong> <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a> is
a free hosting service for <a href="http://opensource.org">Open
source</a> projects. The main web site is found at <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net">http://sourceforge.net</a><br>
Documentation and help files about SourceForge.net can be found at
<a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1</a></p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="g2" id="g2"></a>1.2.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I find QuantLib on SourceForge.net?<br>
A:</strong> The <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib">QuantLib project
page</a> can be found at <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib">http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantlib</a></p>
<h3><a name="g3" id="g3"></a>1.3.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How can I change the pages at
http://quantlib.org?<br>
A:</strong> First you have to be in the SourceForge.net group
"<tt>QuantLib</tt>" (true for all developers). Then you can upload
files using scp:</p>
<blockquote><tt>scp mylocalfile.html
sf_username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/q/qu/quantlib/htdocs/</tt></blockquote>
If you want to edit or remove files, you can use SSH:
<blockquote><tt>ssh -l sf_username shell.sourceforge.net</tt><br>
<tt>cd /home/groups/q/qu/quantlib/htdocs</tt><br>
<tt>rm garbage.html</tt><br>
<tt>vi changeme.html</tt></blockquote>
<h3><a name="g4" id="g4"></a>1.4.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Who is who?<br>
A:</strong> To get the developer name from the user name, go to
<a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=12740">http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=12740</a></p>
<h3><a name="g5" id="g5"></a>1.5.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How do I become a developer?<br>
A:</strong>Contact the QuantLib developers' mailing list
(&lt;quantlib-dev at lists.sourceforge.net&gt;) and describe your
experience and interests. Before doing this, please read:
<ul>
<li>the generic <a href=
"http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/quantlib/QuantLib/dev_tools/newdeveloperintro.txt?view=markup">introduction
for new developers</a></li>
<li>the project <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/reference/overview.html">overview</a>, with its to-do
suggestions</li>
<li>the <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/faq.shtml">FAQ</a></li>
<li>The <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/style.shtml">Programming Style Guidelines</a></li>
<li>the detailed low-level <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/reference/todo.html">to-do list</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="g6" id="g6"></a>1.6.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Which book do you suggest for ...?<br>
A:</strong>Please see this <a href="books.shtml">list of
books</a>.</p>
<!-- section 2 CVS -->
<h1><a name="cvs" id="cvs"></a>2. CVS</h1>
<h3><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>2.1.:</h3>
<p><strong>How do I check out a CVS version of QuantLib?<br>
A:</strong> Detailed instructions are available at <a href=
"http://quantlib.org/cvs.shtml">http://quantlib.org/cvs.shtml</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>2.2.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: What setting should I use?<br>
A:</strong> That is, of course, hard to answer in the general case.
Context diffs (diff -c) are preferred as everything else is harder
to read and I usually have the update command to automatically
checkout new subdirectories and prune empty directories (update -P
-d).</p>
<h3><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>2.3.:</h3>
<strong>Q: I get the following error message:</strong>
<blockquote><tt>Sorry, you don't have read/write access to the
history file /cvsroot/quantlib/CVSROOT/history</tt><br>
<tt>Permission denied</tt></blockquote>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> If you are not a developer, you don't have
read/write access. You have to check out an anonymous copy. If you
are a developer you have to be in the SourceForge.net group
"<tt>QuantLib</tt>". You can check this with the following
commands:
<blockquote><tt>ssh -l sf_username quantlib.org</tt><br>
<tt>groups</tt></blockquote>
If you have just recently (&lt; 6 hours) been added to the QuantLib
project, you probably have to wait for the SourceForge.net servers
to synch up. This can take up to 6 hours.
<h3><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>2.4.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I learn more about CVS?<br>
A:</strong> For SourceForge.net specific information consult their
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">SourceForge.net
CVS documentation</a>, especially their <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=765&amp;group_id=1">
CVS FAQ</a>. For general (and more advanced) information consult
the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">free CVS Book</a> and
the <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">CVS
Docs at www.loria.fr</a></p>
<h3><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>2.5.:</h3>
<strong>Q: How can I remove a directory from the CVS tree?<br>
A:</strong> Simple answer: You cannot!<br>
More complicated answer: Remove all files from the directory,
delete the directory, use the -P (prune) option of the update
command:
<blockquote><tt>cd the_directory</tt><br>
<tt>rm file1 file2 file3</tt><br>
<tt>cvs remove file1 file2 file3</tt><br>
<tt>cvs ci -m "removed all files" file1 file2 file3</tt><br>
<tt>cd ..</tt><br>
<tt>cvs update -P</tt></blockquote>
<h3><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>2.6.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to revert changes?<br>
A:</strong> The fast (and history-friendly) method for backing out
a CVS commit is the use of the <tt>join</tt> flag of the
<tt>update</tt> command. You supply the last version you committed
(and probably messed up) with the first and the version you want to
back out to with the second flag. Example given:</p>
<blockquote><tt>cvs update -j 1.17 -j 1.16 ceval.c</tt><br>
<tt>cvs update</tt><br>
<tt>cvs commit ceval.c</tt><br></blockquote>
This example would create and apply a reverse patch from revision
1.17 to revision 1.16 of <tt>ceval.c</tt>.
<h3><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>2.7.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to add binary files?<br>
A:</strong> You probably want to turn of keyword expansion and
line-ending conversion:</p>
<blockquote><tt>cvs add -kb newfile.bin</tt><br>
<tt>cvs commit newfile.bin</tt><br></blockquote>
<h3><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>2.8.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to force a branch tag on a file?<br>
A:</strong> The quickest way to force a branch tag
<tt>branch_tag</tt> on a file is to issue the command</p>
<blockquote><tt>cvs tag -F -b -r revision branch_tag
file</tt><br></blockquote>
for each file, where <tt>revision</tt> is the revision where the
tag should be and <tt>file</tt> is the file. Note that -F means
<tt>force</tt> (otherwise you get a complaint because the tag is
already defined) and -b means <tt>branch</tt> which makes the tag a
branch tag. <!-- section 3 Patches -->
<h1><a name="patches" id="patches"></a>3. Patches</h1>
<h3><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>3.1.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to make a patch?<br>
A:</strong> If you are using CVS (anonymous or developer) you can
use CVS to make the patches for you. Just edit your local copy and
enter the following command:</p>
<blockquote><tt>cvs diff | tee
~/name_of_the_patch.diff</tt></blockquote>
Else you can use the diff util which comes with most operating
systems (a Windows version is available as part of the cygwin
tools).<br>
<h3><a name="p2" id="p2"></a>3.2.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to submit a patch?<br>
A:</strong> Please read the <a href="#a2">Appendix</a> of this
FAQ.<br></p>
<h3><a name="p3" id="p3"></a>3.3.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to change the status of a patch?<br>
A:</strong> To change the status of a patch or assign it to
somebody else you have to be a) a SourceForge.net-recognized
QuantLib developer and b) a patch administrator. Unfortunately the
SourceForge.net default for developers is not to be patch
administrators. Contact one of the project administrators if the
following does not work for you.</p>
<p>Click on the patch itself. In the screen that comes up, there is
a drop-box for "Assigned To:" and a drop-box for "Status:" where
you can select a new responsible developer or a new status
respectively. After selecting the appropriate victim and status,
hit the "Submit Changes" button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Note: If you are sure that you have the right permissions and a
drop-box does not appear, check that you are actually logged in to
SourceForge.net!</p>
<p>For more information about the use of the "Status:" and
"Assigned To:" fields consult the <a href="#a1">Patch Manager
Guidelines</a>. A recent copy can be found in the Appendix of this
FAQ.<br></p>
<!-- section 4 Windows -->
<h1><a name="windows" id="windows"></a>4. Windows</h1>
<h3><a name="w1" id="w1"></a>4.1.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How to install cvs and ssh<br>
A:</strong> <a href=
"http://python.sourceforge.net/winssh.txt">Here's a link</a> to
text instructions for setting up a command-line CVS using SSH under
Windows, originally developed by Andy Robinson. All the Windows
folks at Reportlab and PythonLabs swear by this scheme.<br>
<strong><em>Afterwards</em></strong> you can download and install
WinCVS, the visual window version of CVS. WinCVS can be found at
<a href="http://www.wincvs.org">http://www.wincvs.org</a></p>
<h3><a name="w2" id="w2"></a>4.2.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Which compiler is supported under Windows?<br>
A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Free Borland C++Builder Compiler (download it from <a href=
"http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/">http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/</a>).<br>

Please feel free to supply Borland project files if you can.</li>
<li>Visual C++ 6.0 (projects files are supplied).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="w3" id="w3"></a>4.3.:</h3>
<p><strong>Q: How can I use SWIG?<br>
A:</strong>Please note that we're using Swig latest release (1.3.9
at the time of this writing). Since the NT port might be not
available yet you have to use CygWin to compile and install
SWIG.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Cygwin setup.exe from <a href=
"http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</a> or any mirrors. A brief
installation guide can be found there.
<ul>
<li>run setup.exe</li>
<li>select "download from internet"</li>
<li>select the package archive directory (for example
C:\archive\cygwin)</li>
<li>select the type of connection you prefer</li>
<li>wait for the mirror list to be downloaded</li>
<li>select a site near you and click next</li>
<li>now it presents you the list of all the packages that will be
downloaded. Choose them as you like (all is suggested)</li>
<li>the packages will be downloaded</li>
<li>run setup.exe once again</li>
<li>select "install from local"</li>
<li>select the package archive directory (C:\archive\cygwin in our
example)</li>
<li>select root directory for installation (suggested:
C:\cygwin)</li>
<li>click install and wait for all the packages to be
installed</li>
<li>check "create icon on desktop" or "add to start menu" if you
like</li>
</ul>
Take note of your CygWin root (we assume it is C:\cygwin from now
on)</li>
<li>Download swig-1.3.9.tar.gz (or any latest release) from
<a href="http://download.sourceforge.net/swig/">http://download.sourceforge.net/swig/</a></li>
<li>Copy the file swig-1.3.9.tar.gz in a directory under the
control of Cygwin (e.g. your home dir C:\cygwin\home\"your
username")</li>
<li>Open a Cygwin shell and type the following commands:
<pre>
$ cd "the directory where swig-1.3.9.tar.gz is"
$ tar xzvf swig-1.3.9.tar.gz
$ cd SWIG-1.3.9
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</pre></li>
<li>Include "C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin" and "C:\cygwin\bin" in your
system variable $PATH. On Win9x, this can be done in a batch file
or autoexec.bat; e.g.,
<pre>
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin;C:\cygwin\bin
</pre>
Run the batch file, or reboot if you're using autoexec.bat. On NT
or 2000, go to Control Panel | System | Environment and set them at
either user or machine level. It's strongly suggested to have the
Cygwin paths added at the end of your $PATH variable so that the
cygwin tools (e.g. make) will not conflict with similar tools
already installed on your machine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you're ready to use Swig.</p>
<p>Please check the QuantLib-Python\README.txt file.</p>

<h1><a name="appendix" id="appendix"></a>A. Appendix</h1>
<h3><a name="a1" id="a1"></a>A.1.: Patch Manager Guidelines</h3>
<h4>Intended use of SourceForge.net patch status &amp; "assigned
to" fields</h4>
<p>In general, the status field should be close to
self-explanatory, and the "Assigned to:" field should be the person
responsible for taking the next step in the patch process. Both
fields are expected to change value over the life of a patch; the
normal work flow is detailed below.</p>
<p>When you've got the time and the ability, feel free to move any
patch that catches your eye along, whether or not it's been
assigned to you. And if you're assigned to a patch but aren't going
to take reasonably quick action (for whatever reason), please
assign it to someone else ASAP: at those times you can't actively
help, actively get out of the way.</p>
<p>If you're an expert in some area and know that a patch in that
area is both needed and non-controversial, just commit your changes
directly -- no need then to get the patch mechanism involved in
it.</p>
<p>You should add a comment to every patch assigned to you at least
once a week, if only to say that you realize it's still on your
plate. This rule is meant to force your attention periodically:
patches get harder &amp; harder to deal with the longer they
sit.<br></p>
<h4>Open</h4>
<blockquote>The initial status of all patches.<br>
The patch is under consideration, but has not been reviewed yet, or
is under review but not yet Accepted or Rejected.<br>
The status will normally change to Accepted or Rejected next.<br>
The person submitting the patch should (if they can) assign it to
the person they most want to review it.<br>
Else the patch will be random assigned to a QuantLib developer.<br>
Discussion of major patches is carried out on the QuantLib mailing
list. For simple patches, the SourceForge.net comment mechanism
should be sufficient.<br>
For the reviewer: If you're certain the patch should be applied,
change the status to Accepted and assign it back to the submitter
(if possible) for checkin. If you're certain the patch should never
be accepted, change the status to Rejected and assign it to None.
If you have specific complaints that would cause you to change your
mind, explain them clearly in a comment, leave the status Open, and
reassign back to the submitter. If you're uncertain, leave the
status Open, explain your uncertainties in a comment, and reassign
the patch to someone you believe can address your remaining
questions; or leave the status Open and bring it up on
QuantLib.</blockquote>
<h4>Accepted</h4>
<blockquote>The powers that be accepted the patch, but it hasn't
been applied yet.<br>
The status will normally change to Closed next.<br>
The person changing the status to Accepted should, at the same
time, assign the patch to whoever they believe is most likely to be
able &amp; willing to apply it (the submitter if
possible).</blockquote>
<h4>Closed</h4>
<blockquote>The patch has been accepted and applied.<br>
The previous status was Accepted.</blockquote>
<h4>Rejected</h4>
<blockquote>The patch has been reviewed and rejected.<br>
There are generally no transitions out of this state: the patch is
dead.<br>
The person changing the status to Rejected should assign it to
None.<br></blockquote>
<h4>Out of date</h4>
<blockquote>Previous status was Open or Accepted or Postponed, but
the patch no longer works.<br>
Please enter a comment when changing the status to "Out of date",
to record the nature of the problem and the previous status.<br>
Also assign it back to the submitter, as they need to upload a new
version (note that SourceForge.net will not allow anyone other than
the original submitter to update the patch).</blockquote>
<h4>Postponed</h4>
<blockquote>The previous status was Open or Accepted, but for some
reason (e.g., pending release) the patch should not be reviewed or
applied until further notice.<br>
The status will normally change to Open or Accepted next.<br>
Please enter a comment when changing the status to Postponed, to
record the reason, the previous status, and the conditions under
which the patch should revert to Open or Accepted. Also assign the
patch to whoever is most likely able and willing to decide when the
status should change again.</blockquote>
<h4>Deleted</h4>
<blockquote>Bit bucket.<br>
Use only if it's OK for the patch and its SourceForge.net history
to disappear.<br>
As of 09-July-2000, SF does not actually throw away Deleted
patches, but that may change.</blockquote>
<h3><a name="a2" id="a2"></a>A.2.: QuantLib Patch Submission
Guidelines</h3>
<p>We use the SourceForge.net Patch Manager. Here are the main
guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit your patch to the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/patch/?group_id=12740">patch manager</a>
interface at <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=12740">SourceForge.net</a>.</strong>
We strongly recommend that you <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">register with
SourceForge.net</a> before submitting a patch. The patch manager is
for <strong>patches</strong> only; if you have a problem or
suggestion but don't know how to write the code for it, use the
<a href="#b1">bug reporting mechanism</a> instead. The bugs list is
searchable; if you have a problem and you're not sure if it has
been reported or fixed already, this is the first place to
look.</li>
<li><strong>Submit documentation patches the same way.</strong>
When adding the patch, be sure to set the
"<strong>Category</strong>" field to
"<strong>documentation</strong>". For documentation errors without
patches, please use the <a href="#b1">bug reporting
mechanism</a>.</li>
<li>We prefer context diffs. PLEASE use context diffs.</li>
<li>We appreciate it if you send patches relative to the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=12740">current CVS tree</a>.
These are our latest sources.</li>
<li>Please try to conform as much as possible to our <a href=
"style.shtml">Coding Guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>Please add a succinct message to your SourceForge.net entry
that explains what the patch is about that we can use directly as a
checkin message. Ideally, such a message explains the problem and
describes the fix in a few lines.</li>
<li>For patches that add or change functionality: please also add
as much <strong>documentation</strong> as you can and possibly a
<strong>testcase</strong> in C++ or Python (see the
QuantLib-Python/QuantLib/test subdirectory).</li>
