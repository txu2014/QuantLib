\section eval_summary Summary

This document summarizes processing for the Evaluation Date.  By default
QuantLib stores the evaluation date as a global variable shared by all objects
in the current QuantLib instance.  Under this implementation, all objects in a
given %QuantLibAddin session - for example, all open workbooks in a given Excel
session - share a single global instance of the evaluation date.

Alternatively QuantLib offers support for Sessions which allow the client
application to implement multiple instances of the evaluation date.  When this
functionality is enabled, %QuantLibAddin defines a session as an Excel
workbook, so that a group of related objects which require a common instance of
the evaluation date can be isolated in a single workbook.

Within any given context, the value of the evaluation date can be set with
QuantLibAddin function
<a href="auto/settings.html#qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate">qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate</a>
and queried with function
<a href="auto/settings.html#qlSettingsEvaluationDate">qlSettingsEvaluationDate</a>.

\section eval_quantlib QuantLib

In QuantLib, the evaluation date is implemented in a global object (called
Settings).  QuantLib supports various methods which enable the client
application to set the value of the evaluation date.  Any object which depends
on the evaluation date consults this global value when required.  If the
evaluation date is not set explicitly then it defaults to the current date as
computed by the system clock (and the value is incremented when the clock
passes midnight).

\section eval_session Session

The behavior described above may lead to undesired results, for example if two
different objects require different evaluation dates within a single running
instance of QuantLib.  To cater for this situation, QuantLib supports the
concept of a Session.  A session constitutes a separate instance of the global
state, i.e. a separate instance of the evaluation date variable.

QuantLib doesn't specify what constitutes the physical implementation of a
session and client applications are left to define this as required for the
local environment.  For example a session could be implemented as a thread, or
as a web service.  Multiple sessions share a single instance of QuantLib.

\section eval_quantlibaddin QuantLibAddin

The %QuantLibAddin default build doesn't implement QuantLib's session functionality.

At present the only means for specifying the evaluation date that is exposed by
the %QuantLibAddin interface is function qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate.  Before any call
to qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate, the evaluation date defaults to the current date on the
system clock; any call to qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate explicitly specifies the
evaluation date.

Consider a single Excel session in which multiple cells invoke
qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate, specifying  different values for the evaluation date.
Each call overwrites the global value.  The sequence in which the calls are
executed is dictated by Excel's dependency calculation tree.  Other cells in
the Excel session which depend on the evaluation date will see a different
value depending on when they are refreshed.

\section eval_workbook Workbook as Session

%QuantLibAddin can be configured to support QuantLib sessions.  %QuantLibAddin
%implements a session as a workbook.  Whenever the value of the evaluation date
%is set - either through an explicit call to qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate, or by
%being left to default to the current system date - that value prevails for all
%sheets and cells in the given workbook.  This has the following implications:

\li If multiple distinct values are required for evaluation date, this can be
effected by using multiple workbooks.  Each workbook contains 1) a single cell
which sets the evaluation date and 2) any objects which may depend on that
value
\li Within a single workbook there is still the potential problem that multiple
calls to qlSettingsSetEvaluationDate overwrite the workbook-wide value of
evaluation date.  Multiple objects requiring different instances of the
evaluation date must not reside in a single workbook.

\section eval_implementation Implementation

To enable support for sessions in QuantLib/QuantLibAddin, edit file

\verbatim
QuantLib\ql\userconfig.hpp
\endverbatim

and uncomment line

\verbatim
#define QL_ENABLE_SESSIONS
\endverbatim

then recompile QuantLib and %QuantLibAddin.

\section eval_multithreading Multithreading

Much of the discussion about QuantLib sessions has centered on the topic of
multithreading, which is not relevant to %QuantLibAddin.  %QuantLibAddin
executes in a single process thread which is shared by all open workbooks in a
given Excel session.

\section eval_crossplatform Cross-Platform Support

At present %QuantLibAddin implements QuantLib sessions only on the Microsoft Excel platform.
