\section coercion_overview Overview

QuantLibXL supports a feature called Coercion in which the arguments to a
function may be automatically converted from one datatype to another.  For
example, wherever a QuantLibXL function expects a quote, any of the
following may be supplied:
\li The ID of a quote object that was previously constructed with a call to
qlSimpleQuote().
\li The ID of a quote handle object that was previously constructed with a call
to qlHandleQuote().
\li A number, which the coercion feature will use to automatically create
a temporary quote object on the fly.

\section coercion_supported Supported Coercions

The table below summarizes the automatic coercions supported by QuantLibXL:

<table>

<tr><td><b>Value Required</b></td><td><b>Supported Inputs</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Quote</td>
<td>
\li ID of a Quote object as returned by qlSimpleQuote()
\li ID of a Quote handle object as returned by qlHandleQuote()
\li number representing quote value
\li this logic is applied to the following Quote classes: FuturesConvAdjustmentQuote, Quote, SimpleQuote</td></tr>
<tr><td>Date</td>
<td>
\li An integer representing the offset in days since 1 January 1970.  This is the format passed by Excel.
\li A period, to be used as the offset from the current evaluation date.  For example, where a function expects a date, and the current evaluation date is 6 July 2005, and the user supplies the string "2Y", then the function receives the date value 6 July 2007.
\li An IMM code such as Z7, which maps to Wed, 20-Dec-2017, i.e. to the corresponding IMM date in the forward decade starting from the current evaluation date.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TermStructure</td>
<td>
\li ID of a TermStructure object as returned by a function such as qlPiecewiseYieldCurve ()
\li ID of a TermStructure handle object as returned by qlRelinkableHandleYieldTermStructure()
\li this logic is applied to the following TermStructure classes: SwaptionVolatilityCube, SwaptionVolatilityDiscrete, SwaptionVolatilityMatrix, SwaptionVolatilityStructure, SwaptionVolCube1, TermStructure, YieldTermStructure</td></tr>
</table>

\section coercion_lists Lists

Functions which expect a list of values accept input in either of the following two forms:
\li A reference to an Excel range of values
\li A string comprising a semicolon-delimited list of values
