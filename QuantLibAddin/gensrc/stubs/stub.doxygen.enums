    \section enum_overview Overview
    %%QuantLibAddin uses a registration manager to translate text strings
    into classes of minor or transient %%QuantLib objects which must be 
    constructed as part of larger operations.  For example the constructor for
    an option accepts string \c PUT to indicate an option type of class
    \c QuantLib::Option::Put.  

    Stateless objects are represented as enumerated types.  Stateful objects
    are represented as enumerated classes.  This page documents all enumerated
    types and classes recognized by %%QuantLibAddin.  Input strings are case 
    insensitive.

    %%QuantLibAddin supports functions for querying enumerated types and
    classes interactively at run time:

\ref ohListEnumeratedClasses ()\n
