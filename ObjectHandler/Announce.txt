Integration of a generic C++ library such as Quantlib into spreadsheets 
and other end user tools requires a standalone ObjectHandler component, 
a repository allowing objects to be stored, shared, updated, 
interrogated, and destroyed.

ObjectHandler shares the QuantLib project structure with regard to distribution, 
licensing, etc., all of which is documented on the main QuantLib website:
http://quantlib.org

Version 0.1.4 has been released and is available for download at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12740

ObjectHandler depends on the Boost library (www.boost.org). You will need a
working Boost installation in order to compile and use ObjectHandler.
Instructions for installing Boost from sources are available at
<http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html>.
Pre-packaged binaries might be available from other sources. Google is
your friend (or Debian, or Fink...)

Please log any problems you have with this release in the SourceForge
bug tracker at
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12740&atid=112740>
specifying that you're using ObjectHandler 0.1.4
