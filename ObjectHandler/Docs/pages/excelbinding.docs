\section xlbind_overview Overview

%ObjectHandler comprises a core C++ library supplemented with additional
bindings in support of functionality for Microsoft Excel.  %ObjectHandler
functions are exported as spreadsheet functions, and additional utilities
are provided to the developer such as conversion of native C++ datatypes
to/from Excel datatypes (e.g. XLOPER).  

The excel bindings are available in two configurations:
<ul>
<li><b>static</b> - core %ObjectHandler is bundled with the Excel binding
into a library which is statically linked into a single client XLL</li>
<li><b>dynamic</b> - %ObjectHandler and the Excel binding are compiled into a
standalone XLL providing a global repository shared by any other XLLs 
in the Excel session</li>
</ul>
