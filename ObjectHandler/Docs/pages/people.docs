ObjectHandler's garbage collection functionality is an implementation of a
technique presented in 
<a href=" http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470024690.html">
Excel Add-in Development in C/C++: Applications in Finance</a> by Steve Dalton.

Unregistration of the Excel addin works around a bug in Excel's xlfUnregister
function using a technique discovered by Laurent Longre.
