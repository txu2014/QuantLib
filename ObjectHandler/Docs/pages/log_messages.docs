\page log_messages Logging and Error Handling

<div align="center"><small><a href="manual.html">back to reference manual index</a></small></div> 

\section log_overview Overview

%ObjectHandler allows specification of a log file where information and error
messages are written.  Function \ref ohLogSetFile is used to enable logging to a
chosen logfile.  Please refer to the functional documentation for specifics
about additional %ObjectHandler functions in support of logging.

\section log_error Error Handling on Excel

On Excel, whenever a function from the %ObjectHandler Addin (or its clients)
encounters an error, the function returns \#NUM to the calling cell.  In this
case a corresponding error message is written to the log file.  The error
message may also be retrieved by calling function \ref ohRangeRetrieveError.

\section log_thresholds Logging Levels (Thresholds)

The underlying logging framework (the log4cxx utility) implements a concept of
thresholds, allowing greater granularity in determining which messages appear
in the logfile.  The %ObjectHandler logging functions expose this threshold
functionality, however it's not really used and the default logging thresholds
are adequate.  In the current implementation it's never necessary to override
the default value for the <tt>loglevel</tt> parameter of the \ref ohLogSetFile
/ \ref ohLogWriteMessage function, nor to call the \ref ohLogSetLevel function.
